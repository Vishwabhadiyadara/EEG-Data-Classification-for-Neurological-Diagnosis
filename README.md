# EEG Data Classification for Epilepsy Diagnosis

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the diagnostic accuracy for neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy, through advanced classification of EEG data. By employing machine learning models, notably Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we intend to improve the early detection and treatment strategies for epilepsy. Leveraging the CHB-MIT and Bonn EEG datasets, the project focuses on developing a robust classification system that can differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal brain activity, thereby facilitating timely and accurate diagnoses.

## Goals

- Develop a highly accurate EEG data classification model for epilepsy diagnosis.
- Enhance early detection of epilepsy through automated EEG analysis.
- Optimize treatment strategies by providing precise diagnostic information.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the LSTM model.
- Scikit-learn for data splitting and model evaluation.
